/*
If you are new to a regular expression in Java, the \s is a character class to detect space including tabs, 
since \ needs to be escaped in Java, it becomes \\s and because there could be multiple spaces between words
we made this regular expression greedy by adding +, hence \\s+ will find one more space and split the String accordingly.
